## Introduction
Many times is it desirable to quantify the pulse width of a periodic signal, such as a servo motor, or duty cycle of a pulse-width modulated signal. This code example demonstrates six different methods for measuring a pulse and a period and calculating the duty cycle based off that measured pulse and period all while using the PIC16F18076. 

## Setup
### Hardware Connections

Connect two PIC16F18076 Curiousity Nano board together following the diagram in Figure 1.

*Figure 1 - Building the Circuit*

Generic Outline:
- Standard beginning for a code example
- Describe the general purpose of this code example
- Mention how it is setup so the input signal is on the same pin (or the same signal is chained to several inputs)
- Mention that the results can be viewed over UART by a logic analyzer
- Mention how each of the sections work
- Mention how the overall project works and how someone else can download the code and get it to work


<!-- Explain how to connect hardware and set up software. Depending on complexity, step-by-step instructions and/or tables and/or images can be used -->

Notes:
- build to make sure both the 'free' and 'pro' configurations are good

## Operation

<!-- Explain how to operate the example. Depending on complexity, step-by-step instructions and/or tables and/or images can be used -->

## Summary

<!-- Summarize what the example has shown -->

Note: A second Cnano was used to simulate the input signal at varying duty cycles.  Replacing the pulse generating Cnano with a different input pulse generator may be advantageous depending on the application.
