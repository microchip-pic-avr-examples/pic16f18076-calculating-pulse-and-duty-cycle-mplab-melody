## Introduction
Many times is it desirable to quantify the pulse width of a periodic signal, such as a servo motor, or duty cycle of a pulse-width modulated signal. This code example demonstrates six different methods for measuring a pulse and a period and calculating the duty cycle based off that measured pulse and period all while using the PIC16F18076. 

## Setup
### Hardware Connections

Connect two PIC16F18076 Curiousity Nano board together following the diagram in Figure 1.

*Figure 1 - Building the Circuit*
<!--add figure-->

Make sure to connect the UART pins to a lofic analyzer so that the results can be viewed.

### Programming
- Download, install, and open MPLABX IDE version 6.00 (or newer).

- Download and install the XC8 C-Compiler version 2.36 (or newer).

- Download and Open the 'pic16f18076-calculating-pulse-and-duty-cycle-mplab-melody.X' project as shown in Figure 2.

## Operation

This example utilizes a button which toggles between the various methods of measuring the pulse width and duty cycle.

### Hardware
- describe the button
- talk about how there is only one input signal (from a pulse source) and one output signal (UART viewed by a logic analyzer)

### Software
There are nine different modes that are built into this example.  The nine modes are the following: 
1. Pulse Generator
2. Timer1 Gate
3. CLC NCO 1
4. CLC NCO 2
5. CLC NCO 3
6. CCP
7. IOC with Timer
8. IOC without Timer
9. Polled Input 

The Pulse generator mode is the default mode of this example.  It generates a 1MHz signal with varying duty cycles. The duty cycles range from 10% to 90% at 10% intervals and constantly loop. Each of the subsequent modes can be triggered by the appropriate amount of button presses (the order is the list above). Each mode takes the input signal from the pulse input pin and calculates the pulse, the period, and the duty cycle for the given pulse, and outputs that information to the logic analyser through UART.  The value for duty cycle is an 8-bit value, so a conversion from an 8-bit value to a 0-100% scale will be necessary.  For more in-depth information please refer to the linked application note at the top of this example.


- describe what each mode does (overview, not in-depth like the app note) and what to expect from each mode
- describe the order of the modes


<!-- Explain how to operate the example. Depending on complexity, step-by-step instructions and/or tables and/or images can be used -->

## Summary

<!-- Summarize what the example has shown -->

Note: A second Curiosty Nano Board was used to simulate the input signal at varying duty cycles (10%-90% at 10% intervals).  Replacing the pulse generating Curiosty Nano Board with a different input pulse generator may be advantageous depending on the application.



Generic Outline:
- Mention how it is setup so the input signal is on the same pin (or the same signal is chained to several inputs)
- Mention how each of the sections work
- Mention how the overall project works
