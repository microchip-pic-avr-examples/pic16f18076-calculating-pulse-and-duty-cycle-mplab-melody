## Introduction
Many times is it desirable to quantify the pulse width of a periodic signal, such as a servo motor, or duty cycle of a pulse-width modulated signal. This code example demonstrates six different methods for measuring a pulse and a period and calculating the duty cycle based off that measured pulse and period all while using the PIC16F18076. 

## Setup
### Hardware Connections

Connect two PIC16F18076 Curiousity Nano boards together following the diagram in Figure 1.

*Figure 1 - Building the Circuit*

## Operation

This example utilizes a button (SW0) which toggles between the various methods of measuring the pulse width and duty cycle (Figure 6). 

*Figure 6 -  PIC16F18076 Curiousity Nano Board SW0 Button*

![PIC16F18076 Curiousity Nano Board SW0 Button](images/PIC16F18076_Curiousity_Nano_Board_SW0_Button.png)

When the button is pressed, it changes the method of measurement based on the list below. 

1. Pulse Generator
2. Timer1 Gate
3. CLC NCO 1
4. CLC NCO 2
5. CLC NCO 3
6. CCP
7. IOC with Timer
8. IOC without Timer
9. Polled Input 

### Pulse Generator
The Pulse Generator mode is the default mode for this example.  It generates a 1MHz signal with varying duty cycles. The duty cycles range from 10% to 90% at 10% intervals and constantly loop. This signal will output the pulse to pin RA3.  An example waveform for the pulse generator can be seen in Figure 7. 

*Figure 7 -  Pulse Generator Waveform Example*

### Timer1 Gate
Timer1 Gate is the first of the measuring modes for this example.  This mode uses only the Timer1 Module to measure the pulse width and duty cycle. The pulse (pin RB5) is measured by having the Timer1 Gate close to connect the Timer1 Clock source to the Timer1 counter when the pulse it high. The period is measured in the same way as the pulse, just the specific interrupt flags change.  The duty cycle is then calculated by taking the pulse and dividing it by the period.  The code outputs an 8-bit value (0-255) which correlates to 0%-100% (i.e. 0x80 or 127 equals 50%). For more details please see the 'Timer1_Gate.c' file. An example waveform for the Timer1 Gate can be seen in Figure 8.

*Figure 8 -  Timer1 Gate Waveform Example*

### CLC NCO 
The CLC NCO is the second, third, and fourth measuring methods for this example.  Each of these methods use either two or three CLC modules, the NCO module, and either the Timer1 module and/or the Timer0 module.

For more details please see the 'Polled_Input.c' file. An example waveform for the Polled Input can be seen in Figure 15.

What does it do:
Input/Output signals:
What is should look like:

*Figure 15 -  Polled Input Waveform Example*

Each of the subsequent modes can be triggered by the appropriate amount of button presses (the order is the list above). Each mode takes the input signal from the pulse input pin and calculates the pulse, the period, and the duty cycle for the given pulse, and outputs that information to the logic analyzer through UART. An example of the UART data can be seen in Figure 7. 

*Figure 7 -  UART on Logic Analyzer*
<!--add figure-->

The value for duty cycle is an 8-bit value, so a conversion from an 8-bit value to a 0-100% scale will be necessary.  For more in-depth information on each of the measurement methods, please refer to the linked application note at the top of this example.

## Results

## Summary

This example has demonstrated sevreral methods of how to measure the pulse width and duty cycle of a pulse on the PIC18F18076 Curiousity Nano Board. 

<!--Note: A second Curiosty Nano Board was used to simulate the input signal at varying duty cycles (10%-90% at 10% intervals).  Replacing the pulse generating Curiosty Nano Board with a different input pulse generator may be advantageous depending on the application. -->
